统计obs_date在20230327-20230328在之间，不同`imagetyp的数据


To get the count of different imagetyp data where obs_date is between 2023-03-27 and 2023-03-28, you can use the following SQL query:
```
SELECT imagetyp, COUNT(*)
FROM exposuresocs
WHERE obs_date BETWEEN '2023-03-25' AND '2023-03-26'
GROUP BY imagetyp;
```
This will return a result set that shows the count of different imagetyp data within the specified date range. The COUNT(*) function counts the number of rows for each group defined by imagetyp. The GROUP BY clause groups the rows based on the values in the imagetyp column.


```
SELECT sum(exposure)
FROM exposuresocs
WHERE obs_date BETWEEN '2023-05-09' AND '2023-05-11' and imagetyp="sc" and object like  'alt%';
```
